    "## Word Embeddings: Learning Meaning from Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this lab:** learn how *continuous vector representations* (embeddings) are learned from data, and how they are used in practical NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"

    "## Part 5 — Vector algebra (analogies)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is in the notebook\n",
    "Vector algebra (analogies) demonstrates one of the most remarkable properties of word embeddings: **semantic relationships are encoded as geometric directions**. This section is included because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validates embedding quality** — If embeddings capture meaningful structure, analogies should work\n",
    "2. **Illustrates the \"linear substructure\" hypothesis** — Relationships like gender, tense, or country-capital are often parallel vectors\n",
    "3. **Common interview/exam topic** — The king–queen analogy is a classic NLP question\n",
    "4. **Foundation for downstream tasks** — Understanding vector arithmetic helps with transfer learning and feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### How vector algebra works\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings often capture relationships as **directions** in vector space. The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the relationship between **king** and **man** is similar to the relationship between **queen** and **woman**, then their difference vectors should be approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "$$\\vec{king} - \\vec{man} \\approx \\vec{queen} - \\vec{woman}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging:\n",
    "$$\\vec{king} - \\vec{man} + \\vec{woman} \\approx \\vec{queen}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic example\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} \\approx \\text{queen} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This works *sometimes* because the model learns consistent patterns across many contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other analogy types that embeddings can capture\n",
    "\n",
    "| Relationship | Example |\n",
    "|--------------|---------|\n",
    "| Verb tense | walk : walked :: swim : swam |\n",
    "| Country–capital | France : Paris :: Japan : Tokyo |\n",
    "| Comparative | big : bigger :: small : smaller |\n",
    "| Plural | cat : cats :: dog : dogs |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analogies are an intrinsic evaluation** — They test the embedding space itself, not real-world task performance\n",
    "- **Results are dataset-dependent** — A model trained on news articles may not capture analogies about cooking or medicine\n",
    "- **Not always reliable** — Even good embeddings can fail on specific analogies due to data biases or polysemy (words with multiple meanings)\n",
    "- **Sensitive to corpus size** — Small corpora may not provide enough context for consistent relationship patterns"

    "However, the clusters are not perfectly separated. This may be explained by several factors. First, PCA reduces high-dimensional embeddings to only two dimensions, which can distort distances and reduce separation between groups. Second, Word2Vec captures contextual similarity, meaning some words may appear in multiple contexts. Finally, the training corpus (20 Newsgroups dataset) contains mixed topics, which can blur boundaries between semantic categories."

    "One-hot vectors are highly sparse, with only one position set to 1 for each word and all others set to 0. Consequently, they cannot reflect semantic similarity between different words. Word vectors map words to a low-dimensional continuous vector space, placing semantically similar words closer together in this space. In this experiment, for instance, “computer” is surrounded by words like ‘networks’ and “engineering,” demonstrating the model's ability to capture technology-related semantic relationships. This continuous representation not only reduces sparsity but also enables measuring semantic similarity between words via cosine similarity. Consequently, embeddings can more effectively support downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "Word vectors are widely used in search engines and recommendation systems. For example, in the semantic search task of this experiment, when “hotel” was entered, the model returned related words such as “airport,” “theatre,” and “denver.” This demonstrates that the model can identify semantically related content, not just exact keyword matches. In real-world search systems, this helps users find more relevant results even when query terms don't perfectly match document vocabulary. Additionally, word vectors are widely applied in tasks like chatbots and text classification.\n",

    "When data contains spelling variations, plural forms, or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, FastText is more suitable. In this experiment, when querying the term “computers,” FastText can identify words like ‘compute’ and “computes,” whereas Word2Vec requires words to be present in the vocabulary to process them. FastText employs subword (character n-gram) modeling, enabling the model to understand morphological variations. Consequently, FastText typically demonstrates greater stability when processing user-generated text, social media data, or specialized terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\n",
    "Word vectors are highly dependent on training corpora. If training data is biased or has limited coverage, the model may learn inaccurate or biased semantic relationships. For example, in this experiment, “king – man + woman” did not yield “queen,” indicating that small-scale or domain-limited data can affect semantic structure. Furthermore, embeddings may map polysemous words from different contexts to the same vector, reducing semantic discrimination capabilities. Therefore, industrial applications require integration with larger corpora or contextual models to mitigate these issues."
